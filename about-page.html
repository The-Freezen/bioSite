            Judy is a hardworking mother, wife, and friend to all. Friends are family and family brings happiness and 
            it is then when she feels the happiest when she is surrounded by family. She was born in September
            1970 to her parents James and Joyce, and she had one brother. Judy met the person who she considers 
            to have been her best friend ever when she was 2, her name was Kim. Judy’s early life was not always 
            the best, however she took every experience as an opportunity to learn and to grow. Judy developed a 
            love for singing when she was in high school through choir and drama where she sang in multiple 
            musicals and concerts being the lead in many of them. While she was in high school, she met the love of 
            her life Rob. Together they enjoyed going out and partying and camping. Robert proposed to Judy in 
            1987 on the night of Robert’s senior year prom, when Judy was a Junior. Judy said yes, and Robert went 
            into the air force in 1987. Following high school Judy left to live with Robert in Okinawa Japan and 
            followed to Florida in 1991. While in Florida, Judy had her first child Jaydon in 1994, and met a few more 
            life long friends that she still talks to today. Judy also has a love for animals, and they got their first dogs 
            PJ an 8 lb Chihuahua, and Mariah a 112lb Great Dane. From Florida they moved to England where they 
            had their second child Cameron. While in England Judy loved to travel and had one of her first 
            paranormal experiences where she saw her mother putting her hand on Judy’s head and saying that 
            everything will be okay. That same day they found a place to live and a new car. After living in England,
            they moved to Arizona where they bought their first house and where Judy met her closest current 
            friend Terri due to her child’s streaking and asking for cheese. In one of their final moves, they moved to 
            Nebraska where they reside today. This was filled with many different clubs and organizations that 
            Judy’s kids were involved in that she loved to be a part of and help out wherever is needed. After Judy’s 
            kids left the house, Judy enjoys hanging out with friends and family, Ghost hunting, painting and getting 
            together with people for the holidays.
