            Judy has been singing throughout most of her life starting in school when she joined choir. Throughout her time at Highschool, Judy sang in many different concerts and had the lead role in a musical put on by the theatre department.
            Throughout her life there were many different opportunities for her to compete in different competitions. Judy has sang in many different locations and events from retirement ceremonies for military personnel, to NASCAR races. 
            Judy's love of of singing stems from the feeling that it gives her when seeing the reaction the audience has to what you are singing. her favorite time singing was in 2002 when Judy was invited to sing the national anthem ath the Phoenix International Raceway
