            <p>
                Judy started ghost hunting later in life when her and robert took a trip to a haunted house and slowly got into ghost hunting. Currently they are in a group with 8 other people who get together around 
                once a month at different locations throughout the midwest to investigate what happened to the families and those who are still present in the house as spirits. They also use many different types of equipment 
                to help assist with the different things and have different types of sensors.
